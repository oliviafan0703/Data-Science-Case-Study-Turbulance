# ML-Data-Mining-Case-Study

The dataset consists of n = 89 simulations, each conducted at a different parameter setting. There are three parameters (predictors): Reynolds number Re, gravitational acceleration Fr, and particle characteristic St (details in presentation slides). The original response variable (obtained from numerical simulation and cluster analysis) is a probability distribution for particle cluster volumes. However, since probability distributions are hard to work with, we will instead summarize it by its first four raw moments (i.e., E[X], E[X2], E[X3], E[X4]), thus creating four new response variables.
